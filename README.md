# 42_Cpp_Module_05

The goal of the **C++ modules 00 to 08** is to introduce the student to Object-Oriented Programming and the C++ programming language in general.
Because of the complexity of the language, the students code has to comply with the C++98 standard.

**C++ module 05** introduces the learner to the fundamental programming concept of exceptions.

## Description

ex00:  
Code a 'Bureaucrat' class, with a grade in a specific range. If someone tries to instanciate a Bureaucrat with an invalid grade, throw an exception.  
(intro to exceptions and exception classes)

ex01:  
Implement a class 'Form', which is only signable holding a Bueraucrat with a specific grade. If Bueraucrats grade too high or low, throw the corresponding exception.  
(catching and using the exceptions return in a function)

ex02:  
Change 'Form' class to abstract class, and write 3 sub-classes with different behaviour, to implement different exceptions.  
(repetition of C++ file manipulation & exception handling in sub-types)

ex03:  
Create an 'Intern' class with a 'makeForm(arg a, arg b)' function. If 'arg a' exists, the function will return a Form object with name 'arg a' and target initialized to 'arg b'.  
(repetition of exception handling, switch statement and function pointers)

## Learnings

Repeating all the concepts and topics of C++ and OOP learned so far, and refreshing my knowledge of exception handling in C++, as well as a short excursion into nested classes.
